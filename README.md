-Created a car sensor using an ultrasonic distance sensor, buzzer, LEDs and resistors that have the purpose of acting like a sensor that indicates how close the back of the car is to an obstacle. This was done using C++ and programmed to activate corresponding LEDs with specific distances.

-The two images provided are the physical project. One is the Arduino UNO that is used to program the projects and the other is a picture of the actual circuit. 

-The ino file includes the code from Arduino IDE that programs the car sensor to work.
